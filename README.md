# Full Stack Developer Portfolio

This one-page website links to webpages I've built using CSS, HTML5, and Javascript. I used the [Bulma CSS](http://bulma.io/) framework. As I complete projects in the Udacity course, I'll add them to this page and fine-tune the main image and message/brand. 

### View the Site

The site is public at [jennerhanni.net/full-stack-portfolio](http://jenenrhanni.net/full-stack-portfolio/) and the source code is available in the [dist folder](https://github.com/wicker/Full-Stack-Portfolio/tree/master/dist).

### View the Site Locally

Fork and/or clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/wicker/Full-Stack-Portfolio.git
```

Open your browser of choice and use its version of `File > Open` to view the page in `Full-Stack-Portfolio/dist/index.html`.
